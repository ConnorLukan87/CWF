Currently we have only tested our code on 64-bit windows systems and Visual Studio 2022 Professional.

### Dependence

- CGAL
- Eigen3
- Boost
- Libigl
- NVIDIA CUDA Toolkit

### Please using vcpkg to install dependent libraries!!!

#### Important: Please use  "git clone" to install vcpkg, otherwise you may get errors in cgal installation.

- .\vcpkg install boost:x64-windows
- .\vcpkg install cgal:x64-windows
  
  â€‹	use "git pull" if you get errors with the "gmp" library.
- .\vcpkg install Eigen3:x64-windows
- .\vcpkg install libigl:x64-windows
- .\vcpkg integrate install

### MSVC on Windows

Open up the project in Visual Studio Code, open the Developer Command Prompt.

- mkdir build
- cd build
- msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj

## Test

The example is in 'MAIN'.

All the files is in 'CWF\data'.

The output files is in 'CWF\data\LBFGSOUT'.

We put the result of our operation in 'CWF\data\LBFGSOUT\DemoOutput', you can use it for comparison to know whether the program is running correctly.

## IMPORTANT NOTE:

Make sure you are using C++ 14, not C++ 17 or newer versions. 

## Testing Platform

- Windows 10
- Visual Studio 2022
- 13th Gen Intel i9-13900HX CPU
- NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4070 GPU
- 64GB Memory
